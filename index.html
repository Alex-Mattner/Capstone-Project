	<!--Hello, 
		I do not feel very pround, but I guess I have to say that "this is my final project." :-( 
		The non-responsive part at least looks somehow like the mockup but I had a lot of trouble doing the responisve part. I tried a lot, but at the end it became quite a chaos and so I deleted most of my responisve attempts so it does not get too exhausting for you while looking over my project. 
		
		Nevertheless, I did learn a lot doing this project. I decided to finally turn it in now, becasue I figured that after learning from some corrections of yours I will start it all over again to finish it for myself. I really did not want to give up on that, but after a while the whole thing became such a mess that I feelt like it is much better to start all over again instead of continuing to look for my mistakes.

		Do you happen to have a possible suggestion for a solution on this project? Especailly the responsive part? 
		I would love to check and see how you guys do it and to learn from you and then to do it all over again for myself. 

		Really sorry for turining in such a mess. Please excuse me. 

		Anyway, this course is really great and I will go over it again reviewing the lessons and the projects. I am very confident if I do my reviewing properly I can catch up on a couple of topics I am lacking some skill in at the moment.

		Thanks a lot for your help and support. It was a great course. When I am able to confidently finish the capstone project for myself I am planning to enroll in another one of your intesive seminars. It was great fun. Take care, 
		Alex-->
